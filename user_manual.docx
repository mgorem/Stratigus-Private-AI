Introduction
This guide shows you how to set up and run a local AI assistant that can read and analyse any public web page. You do not need to be a programmer. By the end, you will be able to paste a website link into a simple window and get a summary or analysis from your local LM Studio model.
What You Need Before You Start
-	A Windows computer
-	LM Studio installed and working
-	Python 3.10 or newer (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-	The “Stratigus LM Studio Web Agent” folder (we will send this to you as a zip file)
Step 1: Download the Agent Package
-	We will send you a file called strategus-lmstudio-web-agent.zip.
-	Save it somewhere easy to find (e.g. Desktop or Documents).
-	Right-click it and choose ‘Extract All’.
-	You should now see a folder called strategus-lmstudio-web-agent.
Step 2: Open the Folder in PowerShell
-	Open the stratigus-lmstudio-web-agent folder.
-	Click in the white area of the address bar at the top.
-	Type powershell and press ‘Enter’.
-	A blue or black window will open. This window is now “inside” the agent folder.
Step 3: Run the Setup Script (Automatic Method)
In the black window, copy and paste this command as it is without the brackets: (.\setup_agent.ps1) and press ‘Enter’.
-	A new PowerShell window may open and start installing required components.
-	When it finishes, you will see the prompt ready again and no error messages.
Step 4: Prepare LM Studio
-	Open LM Studio.
-	Go to the Models section.
-	Download and load any model that supports tools (your IT support person can choose one for you or you can choose the one used in this case: ‘qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct’).
-	Go to Settings  Local LLM Service / Local Server.
-	Turn the Local Server ON.
-	Leave LM Studio open while you use the agent.
Step 5: Start the Web Analysis Agent
-	Go back to the stratigus-lmstudio-web-agent folder if not already there.
-	Click in the address bar and type the word powershell and press ‘Enter’.
-	Inside powershell (the black/blue window), type (.\run_agent.ps1) excluding the brackets and press ‘Enter’.
-	A window will open with this prompt: 
‘User (Please prompt the tool to fetch and summarise a page of your choice or blank + Enter to exit):’.
Example Queries You Can Try:
	Please summarise this page: https://www.python.org
	Analyse the main topics on this page: https://www.bbc.com/news
	Explain this page in simple language: https://example.com/some-article
Troubleshooting (Common Problems):
-	Python is not recognised → Ask IT to install Python in your device.
-	LM Studio connection error → Make sure Local LLM Service is ON (Step 4).
-	Model error → Change model name in agent.py (handled by IT).
